# Beyond-Code-Club
Extending Code Club by designing your own projects.

Although related to Code Club projects, and intended for attendees of Code Club meetings, this repository is not endorsed by [Code Club](https://www.codeclub.org.uk/), nor is it connected to or maintained by Code Club. Comments and statements made in this repository are not a criticism of Code Club, and should not be taken as such. If, in any way, you support the aims of Code Club, you are hereby encouraged to visit their site and to add yourself as a volunteer if you are not already registered.

This 'project' consists of two parts. The intention is to provide a guide to the implications of moving 'beyond a code club project' to create your own, possibly more complex, project.

* A presentation / workshop on the structure of a project, much of which is currently performed by Code Club and which you will have to consider in your project. It includes some audience participation exercises; you should be able  to complete this within a half hour, but this depends on how long you allow for discussion. It is strongly suggested that you run through the presentation and time yourself to understand how long you should allow for discussion.

* An exercise in Scratch, showing the requirements for coding a project using several people who work independently, then for building the completed project from the individual parts. This is a likely scenario for larger projects. Using the standard features of the [Scratch website](https://scratch.mit.edu/), each element can be created separately then 'assembled' into the final Scratch project. This can follow the presentation, and uses some of the final slides to introduce the project.
