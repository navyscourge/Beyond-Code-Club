# Building the Scratch project

Note:
* When complete, ensure that the resulting project is tested, looking in particular at timing and positioning of the parts.
* If any part is changed, care must be taken if these parts are added to the project if the project is not totally rebuilt:
  * a costume added to the sprite becomes part of that sprite, do not overwrite the non-costume sprite unless this is intended
  * a sprite with a changed costume or script will need to be added to the resulting project so it is updated
  * changes to sizes or positions must be done for all affected parts

To separate the development parts and the build parts, a source folder and a build folder is used.

Follow these steps to build the Scratch project.

- [ ] Ensure that there is a `source` folder and a `build` folder
- [ ] Ensure that the `build` folder is empty
- [ ] Ensure that the `source` folder contains the latest versions of all the parts (a list is needed!)
